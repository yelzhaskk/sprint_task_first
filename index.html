                <h1>Khabib to Conor: "It is the same thing"</h1>
                <p><br>Its the same thing as the previous fight. If its a first round finish, I'd back Conor. 
                    From th second and further, then Dustin wins.<br><br> 
                    The Russian - who retired in March with a record of 29-0 with eight knockouts - has
                    submission victories over both McGregor and Poirier, to he knows a thing or two about
                    their game plans and skillsets.<br><br>
                    He memorably scaled the Octagon at UFC 229 after defeating McGregor to attack his 
                    cornerman Dillon Danis, who had reportedly shouted insults at Khabib following 
                    the fight. The Russian has turned to promoting following his retirement and is 
                    mentoring fellow awllightweight Islam Makhachev - currently ranked #9 in the UFC rankings.
